          I developed a custom Revit plugin using IronPython and pyRevit by integrating a variety of useful scripts from pyRevit and its extensions, along with several custom tools I built to match our officeâ€™s specific workflows. The result was a streamlined toolset that significantly improved day-to-day efficiency. I'm excited to continue applying and growing these skills to drive even greater impact in the office and beyond.
